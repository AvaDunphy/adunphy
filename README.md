# Hi There, I'm Ava!
Hello! My name is Ava Dunphy, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Notre Dame. I walked onto the Women's Rowing Team as a coxswain, and I am majoring in Finance and minoring in Real Estate and Computer Data Technologies. Beyond academics, I am deeply interested in aviation ✈️, travel 🏝️ , and real estate 👩‍💼. These interests drive my desire to establish a career that combines innovation and strategy with a global perspective.
